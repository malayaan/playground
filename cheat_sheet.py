Consumer Credit – Document Authenticity Analysis (SG Retail France)

As part of the credit risk review on consumer loans within SG Retail France, a targeted analysis was conducted to assess the reliability of income supporting documents provided at loan origination.
The study relied on two main data sources:

the document repository (GED) containing client tax statements and supporting documents linked to consumer credit files;

the iConso application, used by advisors for loan input and client data entry.


The approach consisted in extracting and decoding 2D-DOC authentication codes embedded in official tax documents, in order to compare the fiscal data (e.g., income, tax year, name) with the information entered by the advisor in iConso.
Detected mismatches were then reviewed manually by audit teams to distinguish simple input errors from potential document falsifications.

This two-step process — combining automated verification with human review — proved effective in identifying fraudulent or altered income documents, and highlighted the value of integrating 2D-DOC controls into front-line credit origination workflows.
