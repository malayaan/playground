Shortcomings in Loan Tape Controls:

1. Inherent Limitations
The current approach to controls on the Loan Tape is inherently limited, failing to detect all unexpected anomalies.

2. High Number of False Positives
Additionally, it generates a high number of false positives in the control results.

3. Lack of Prioritization
Furthermore, there is no way to prioritize data quality issues by criticality.
