Context: Defining the Automotive Sector and Identifying Exposure

The objective is to clearly define the scope of the automotive sector within Société Générale and assess the bank's exposure to it. This involves not only identifying the primary actors in the automotive value chain but also understanding the financial flows related to these sectors, particularly as they relate to geographical markets. The analysis will focus on:

Identifying key actors: This includes automakers, parts manufacturers, dealerships, leasing companies, and the entire automotive value chain.

Defining the sector’s scope: The focus will be on automotive financing, leasing, parts manufacturing, and all related activities across regions.

Identifying financial flows: Understanding financial flows emanating from these sectors to various geographical regions, including loans, investments, and leasing operations that contribute to exposure.
