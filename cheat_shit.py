Subject: Discussion on sector quantitative analyses – quant equity collaboration

Hello,

As part of our inspection mission, we are working on a data analysis to understand the sensitivity of the automotive sector to macroeconomic factors and its impact on other sectors. The goal is to better grasp the specific risks linked to this sector and the group’s exposures.

To avoid overlap and benefit from your expertise, we would like to discuss with your team to:

Understand the data sets and factor models you use to assess sector risks.

Identify the key risk factors affecting the automotive sector and related sectors.

Explore any additional data or indicators that could enhance our analysis.


We would appreciate the opportunity to arrange a meeting at your convenience to discuss these points.

Thank you in advance for your response.

Best regards,
[First Name Last Name]
Data Science Inspector – Société Générale Inspection Mission
