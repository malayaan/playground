Subject: Follow-up on our meeting – Channeling & PrediXia data

Hi Jasper,

Thanks again for your time and for the very helpful discussion on the channeling topic.

Here is a short summary of the key points we understood:

There is strong heterogeneity between countries in how channeling is managed:
→ In Spain, around 30% of vehicles are re-channeled.
→ In Belgium, about 22%.
→ In Germany, around 90% of vehicles go automatically to B2B, which shows a lack of steering, even if losses are lower because maintenance costs come after the sale.

Global steering remains very limited:
→ There is no consolidated view of losses linked to rechanneling.
→ The real profitability of channels is poorly monitored.

About CGI, you mentioned it is a nice-to-have for now, but could be very relevant in a few months. It seems to fit well with the long-term goals of the model.

Finally, you said the PrediXia model is performing well. We would like to see some details on that if possible.

To continue the work, would it be possible to share or help us find:

1. Key data or documents:

Rechanneling rates by country

Estimations of financial losses

Any information about channel profitability (even partial)



2. Key contacts in France:

People in charge of channel allocation rules

Existing rule-based decision scenarios (if any)



3. For PrediXia:

Performance monitoring of the model, ideally by country




Thanks a lot in advance for your help,
Best regards,
[Your name]
