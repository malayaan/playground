Subject: Questions about the PrediXia model and local reproduction

Hi José María,

I hope you are doing well.

I would like to confirm that the PrediXia model has been in production since January 2025.

In France, I understand the model is used to calculate the sale price, which is then used as input for the model predicting sectoral sales probability. Could you please confirm if this is correct?

Also, I noticed that in Spain, feature importance seems linked to one model, but I understand there are actually two models (one for pricing and one for sectoral sales probability). Could you please clarify this?

Finally, to reproduce the model locally, I would like to use data on vehicles financed by Société Générale. Could you share details on data sources, preprocessing, and feature construction?

Thank you very much for your help.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
