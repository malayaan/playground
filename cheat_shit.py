Use Case 3 – Strategic Alignment CGI / Ayvens through Vehicle Analysis

Step 1 – Consolidated CGI Dataset Construction (10 days)

Clean and structure the dataset of vehicles financed by CGI: type, price, purchase and resale dates, time on lot, RWA.

Build a monthly view of stock evolution, rotation dynamics, and risk exposure.

Goal: Understand business trends and dealer portfolio evolution.


Step 2 – Consolidated Ayvens Dataset Construction (10 days)

Aggregate leasing data from Ayvens: residual value, contract duration, resale price, VR adjustments, RWA.

Monthly tracking of portfolio dynamics and residual vs. actual resale value discrepancies.

Goal: Identify key performance drivers within the Ayvens leasing model.


Step 3 – CGI / Ayvens Cross-Analysis (10 days)

Match comparable vehicles (segment, powertrain, period) between datasets, focused on France.

Compare resale performance (price and delay) across B2B (Ayvens) and B2C (dealers) channels.

Goal: Detect underperforming segments and support data-driven collaboration between CGI and Ayvens on resale strategy optimization.
