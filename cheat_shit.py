Subject: Questions about PrediXia model and local reproduction for enhancement

Hi José María,

I hope you’re doing well.

I’d like to confirm that the PrediXia model has been in production since January 2025.

As I understand, in France the model calculates the sale price, which is then used as input for predicting sectoral sales probability. Could you please confirm this?

I also noticed that in Spain, feature importance seems linked to one model, but there are actually two models (pricing and sectoral sales probability). Could you clarify this?

My goal is to reproduce the model locally in France to test if enriching it with group-level data (specifically on vehicles financed by Société Générale) can improve its performance.

Could you please share the data sources, preprocessing steps, and feature construction details needed for this?

Thank you very much for your support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
