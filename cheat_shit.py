Context

This approach aims to better understand how economic sectors — especially the automotive sector — react to macroeconomic shocks. By identifying “stressed” market days (using VIX/VSTOXX), we observe major sectoral and company-level movements. The goal is to uncover cross-sensitivities between sectors, firms, and macro factors to highlight potential vulnerabilities.

Limitations: empirical approach reliant on the quality of selected indicators and stress thresholds; does not directly model financial losses or exposure.
