✅ Meeting Script – Discussion with the Product Owner (PrediXia & Rechanneling)

1. Quick intro

> Hi, thank you for taking the time.
I’m part of the inspection team at Société Générale, currently working on the automotive sector.
One of my tasks is to understand how data can help reduce risk and improve processes at Ayvens.



2. Context of the mission

> In Spain, a data science model (PrediXia) was developed to improve resale channel allocation.
The idea is to reduce rechanneling (around 30% today), which creates operational and financial costs.
In France, a similar need exists, but the model is not used yet.



3. Goals of the meeting

Understand the current status of the resale channel decision process in France.

Identify technical and organizational blockers that may prevent using or improving the model.

Get your view on how product owners see the potential of such a solution.


> One of the targets identified during our mission is to increase B2C sales, as it seems to bring higher margins. We’d like to understand what limits this channel today.



4. Questions – grouped by topic

🔧 Operational / Functional

How is the resale channel currently selected in France? Are there clear business rules?

Who decides? Is the process centralized or done by local teams?

Is there data already used to help this decision?


📊 Data & tools

Is there a structured data set of past resale operations (channel, price, time to sell, etc.)?

Can we access the current features used in Spain? Are they available in France?

What KPIs are monitored today? Rechanneling rate? Profitability per channel?


🚧 Blockers

From your point of view, what are the main limits today? Technical? Governance? Adoption?

Do you think the tool could be reused in France, or would it need major changes?

Is there interest on the business side for this kind of predictive tool?


🤝 Collaboration

Who should we talk to next (data owner, marketing lead, IT, etc.)?

Is there a plan to deploy or test such tools in other countries?


5. Wrap-up

> Thanks again. We’ll write a short note internally to summarize the situation.
If possible, we may come back later with more precise questions, or for a follow-up session.
