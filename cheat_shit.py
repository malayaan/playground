Advantages of a Data-Driven Approach:

1. Revealing Hidden Patterns:

Detects complex interactions between binary fields and other variables that static rules often miss.



2. Objective Prioritization:

Uses anomaly scores to focus on the most critical fields and issues, ensuring efficient resource allocation.



3. Continuous Improvement:

Adapts to data changes, uncovering emerging anomalies without overhauling existing rules.
