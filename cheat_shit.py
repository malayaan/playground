Subject: Follow-up on PrediXia – request for additional details

Hi José-María,

Thank you again for the time you gave me on Monday. To confirm my understanding and prepare the French scoping, here is a brief recap:

PrediXia uses 4–5 years of sales history plus market data to predict

1. the optimal resale price and


2. the probability of selling within 60 days.



The CatBoost model relies on three feature families:
• Auction info (number of traders, bids, etc.)
• Sales historical data (segment, power-train, age, mileage, colour, …)
• External market data.

Main goal: reduce the ~33 % of vehicles that need re-channeling (and the related storage/transport costs).

KPIs tracked: MAPE on price and success rate ≤ 60 days, monitored daily.


Could you, when convenient, share the following items?

1. Full feature list and CatBoost feature-importance ranking.


2. Business slides describing the problem, the model, and the achieved gains.


3. Performance metrics (MAPE, success rate, monitoring curves).


4. Data dictionary (sources for Sales Historical, Market Data, Auction Info) + data-owner contacts.


5. If possible, an anonymised sample or a notebook showing the data-prep steps.



These documents will help us assess how to transfer the approach to France and prepare a POC aligned with our local allocation rules.

Please let me know if I mis-stated anything above.
Many thanks in advance for your help!
