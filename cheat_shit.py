Context

Two distinct channels:

Ayvens: long-term leasing, B2B fleets, recent vehicles.

CGI: dealer financing of used vehicles, B2C sales.


Large but siloed datasets: historical residual values, resale prices, holding periods, exposures.

Issue: ranges, channels, and data quality differ, making direct comparison difficult and justifying a structured cross-analysis.
